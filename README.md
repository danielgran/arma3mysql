# ArmA3MySQL
## Overview
This project is a MySQL Wrapper around the ArmA3 SQF-Engine. Basically its a standard C Library which can be called via the standard functions defined in dlfcn.h:
- dlopen()
- dlsym()
- dlclose()
just like the A3Engine does.

## Motivation
Unfortunately the great extDB3 Plugin from the beloved torndeco was just not working as expected.
In addition i am currently learning C and C++ at my university. I see this as a part of my personal programming journey. I do coding for at least 8 years from now and never considered to bother with the low level C stuff.
But i must really say once you are into it and got a grasp on the fundamentals (pointers, memory allocation, addresses, etc.) it really starts to make fun - at least for me.
